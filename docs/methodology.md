# Methodology: Supply Chain Problem Analysis

## 1. Problem Definition & Scoping

### 1.1 Original Business Problem Statement

**Stakeholder:** Supply Chain Manager  
**Date:** 06/01/2025  
**Urgency:** High - Critical operational impact

**Original Problem Description:**
> "Our suppliers keep missing their delivery targets, and we don't know when to expect the shipments. As a result, we are experiencing delays in production, stockouts, or overstocking. Our inbound or outbound volumes are all over the place — sometimes way above or below forecasts, resulting in poor inventory planning, under/over-utilization of storage and transport. We're seeing a spike in returns, and we don't know why."

### 1.2 Problem Decomposition

The supply chain manager's complaint encompasses multiple interconnected issues that need to be separated and prioritized:

#### A. Supplier Delivery Performance Issues
- **Core Problem:** Suppliers missing delivery targets
- **Impact:** Unknown shipment timing affecting production planning
- **Measurable Aspect:** Delivery reliability and lead time variability

#### B. Demand Forecasting Accuracy Problems
- **Core Problem:** Inbound/outbound volumes "all over the place"
- **Impact:** Poor inventory planning decisions
- **Measurable Aspect:** Forecast accuracy vs. actual volumes

#### C. Resource Utilization Inefficiencies
- **Core Problem:** Under/over-utilization of storage and transport
- **Impact:** Increased operational costs and inefficiencies
- **Measurable Aspect:** Capacity utilization rates and cost per unit

#### D. Returns Pattern Anomalies
- **Core Problem:** Spike in returns with unknown root cause
- **Impact:** Additional costs and operational burden
- **Measurable Aspect:** Return rates, patterns, and categorization

### 1.3 Problem Prioritization

Based on business impact and data availability assessment:

**Priority 1: Supplier Delivery Performance**
- **Why First:** Root cause of downstream issues
- **Business Impact:** Direct effect on production scheduling
- **Data Availability:** Likely good (delivery dates, PO data)
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Clear pain point for operations team

**Priority 2: Demand Forecasting Accuracy**
- **Why Second:** Affects inventory planning decisions
- **Business Impact:** Stockouts and overstocking costs
- **Data Availability:** Requires historical demand and forecast data
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Critical for purchasing and planning teams

**Priority 3: Returns Pattern Analysis**
- **Why Third:** Isolated issue with specific business impact
- **Business Impact:** Processing costs and customer satisfaction
- **Data Availability:** May be limited or poorly structured
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Important but not blocking other operations

**Priority 4: Resource Utilization Optimization**
- **Why Fourth:** Dependent on solving upstream issues first
- **Business Impact:** Cost optimization opportunity
- **Data Availability:** Requires multiple data sources integration
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Long-term efficiency gain

### 1.4 Focused Problem Statement

**Primary Focus:** Supplier delivery performance reliability

**Specific Problem Definition:**
"Develop a system to predict and identify when suppliers are likely to miss delivery targets, enabling proactive management of production schedules and inventory planning."

**Measurable Objectives:**
1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Identify potential delivery delays 7-14 days in advance
2. **Detection Accuracy:** Flag actual delivery anomalies within 24 hours
3. **Business Impact:** Reduce production delays by 20%
4. **Operational Efficiency:** Decrease manual monitoring effort by 50%

### 1.5 Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- **Delivery Prediction Accuracy:** >80% precision in identifying late deliveries
- **False Positive Rate:** <15% of delivery delay alerts
- **Business Impact:** 20% reduction in production delays
- **Implementation Timeline:** Working prototype within 8 weeks

**Secondary Success Metrics:**
- **Stakeholder Adoption:** >90% of supply chain team using the system
- **Data Quality Improvement:** Identification of data gaps and quality issues
- **Process Improvement:** Documentation of improved supplier management workflows

### 1.6 Scope Definition

**In Scope (Root Causes the Project Will Address):**
- **Unpredictable supplier deliveries** – Detection and prediction of abnormal delivery behavior through monitoring and early warning systems  
- **Volatile inbound/outbound volumes** – Identification of volume anomalies and forecast deviations using historical data and anomaly detection models  
- **Return pattern anomalies** – Analysis focused on returns likely caused by upstream supply issues such as quality or fulfillment problems  
- **Key supplier performance metrics** – Monitoring lead times, delivery reliability, and order completeness over time  
- **Integration with internal supply chain systems** – Accessing and processing relevant data from ERP, procurement, and logistics systems  
- **Dashboard for supply chain operations** – Real-time interface for monitoring alerts, trends, and supplier reliability insights  

**Out of Scope (Symptoms the Project Will Not Directly Address):**
- **Manual inventory rebalancing** – The project will identify inventory risk drivers, but not manage physical stock movements  
- **Production schedule adjustments** – Alerts will support planning, but operational schedule changes remain the responsibility of production teams  
- **Supplier relationship management** – While supplier performance issues will be flagged, negotiation and communication remain with the purchasing team  
- **Case-level return processing** – The focus is on identifying systemic return trends, not handling individual return events  
- **Warehouse staffing or resource allocation** – Decisions regarding labor and space management are outside project scope  
- **Emergency procurement actions** – The project will predict supply risks, but alternate sourcing is handled by procurement  
- **Storage and transport optimization** – These are downstream effects that may improve as variability is reduced, but are not directly addressed by this project  

### 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints

**Key Assumptions:**
- Historical delivery data is available and reasonably accurate
- Supplier performance patterns are identifiable from historical data
- Supply chain team will provide domain expertise for validation
- Current systems can provide necessary data access

**Known Constraints:**
- Data quality may vary across suppliers
- Limited to internal data sources initially
- Must integrate with existing workflow tools
- 8-week timeline for initial prototype

**Risk Factors:**
- Data availability may be limited for some suppliers
- Supplier performance may have changed due to external factors
- Stakeholder availability for requirements gathering and validation

### 1.8 Stakeholder Alignment

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Supply Chain Manager:** Problem owner, success criteria validation
- **Operations Team:** End users, workflow integration requirements
- **Purchasing Team:** Supplier relationship context and constraints
- **IT Team:** Data access, system integration requirements

**Success Validation Process:**
1. **Week 2:** Stakeholder interviews and requirements validation
2. **Week 4:** Initial data analysis findings review
3. **Week 6:** Prototype demonstration and feedback
4. **Week 8:** Final solution presentation and approval

**Communication Plan:**
- Weekly status updates to Supply Chain Manager
- Bi-weekly stakeholder reviews
- Ad-hoc consultations with domain experts as needed
