```

### Docker Deployment
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Overview

### Problem Statement
Detection of anomalies in supply chain operations including:
- Lead time irregularities
- Volume fluctuations  
- Return pattern anomalies
- Fraud-related deviations

### Solution Architecture
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised anomaly detection for high-dimensional data
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for identifying outlier patterns
- **Control Charts**: Statistical process control for time-series monitoring
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combined model predictions for enhanced accuracy

### Tech Stack
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, PyOD, pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit/Dash for real-time monitoring
- **Data Processing**: pandas, scipy
- **Deployment**: Docker, Flask/FastAPI
